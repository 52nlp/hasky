try to use train-exp.sh first for experiment comparation  

# davenag https://github.com/devnag/tensorflow-pointer-networks this is simple just put here but not suggest to follow

# static https://github.com/ikostrikov/TensorFlow-Pointer-Networks  this is great simple example static rnn    

# static2 similar as static but using seq2seq.attention_wrapper, this is suggested usage!!   

# static-legacy this is same as static but make smallest change to original work so can be baseline for compare  

# dynamic https://github.com/devsisters/pointer-network-tensorflow  this is great simple example dynamic rnn
