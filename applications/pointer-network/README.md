# static https://github.com/ikostrikov/TensorFlow-Pointer-Networks  this is great simple example static rnn    

# static2 similar as static but using tf.contrib.seq2seq.attention_wrapper, this will be slower since more un necessary ops calc, just for showing how to use attention_wrapper  

# dynamic https://github.com/devsisters/pointer-network-tensorflow  this is great simple example dynamic rnn
